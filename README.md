This is a simple csv to SQLite converter.<br>
It was initially thought in the context of a boot camp at Masterschool, where students were eager to train their SQL skills.<br>
We thus wanted to provide a hands-on solution for students to import a .csv of their liking to convert it in a SQLite database for data exploration.<br>
<br>
As such, this code allows one to upload a .csv; normalize the column's names; and output a .db file for use in an application of choice.<br>
<br>

## Usage<br>
.ipynb: Google Colab: Upload directly via the "File" menu or open from Google Drive<br>
Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter, start it via terminal, and open the .ipynb file through the interface<br>
<br>
If using another IDE, you will need the following libraries:<br>
* os<br>
* shutil<br>
* pandas<br>
* sqlite3<br>
* sqlalchemy<br>
<br>
